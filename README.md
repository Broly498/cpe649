# cpe649
CPE-649 Software Studio

This project is built on the sentinel2-cloud-detector repistory located here: https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector

All additions have been placed in the examples subdirectory and can be run through python3 as long as the package and all dependencies are installed (see original repo for instructions).

In addition, the necessary python programs have been precompiled as executables and packaged with all necessary runtime files for your convenience. This package had files that were too large for Github and so it can be accessed at the following drive link (will need to be logged in to an @uah.edu email to access):

An additional library was used to perform power measurements. The git repository for that is located here: https://github.com/regisin/ina219.git
