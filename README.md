# cpe657
CPE-657 Software Studio

Repository Contents:
 * dependencies/sentinel2-cloud-detector/
    * This project uses the sentinel2-cloud detector software located in: https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector
    * The original codebase was modified and placed in an internal repository in order to track changes that were not merged back to the mainline repository.
    * For more information relating to the sentinel2-cloud detector, refer to the documentation located in this directory.

 * examples/
    * This directory contains custom scripts that are used to generate images, encrypt images, compress images, and transmit images to an FTP server.
    * Image data files that are generated by the sentinel2-cloud detector software are temporarily stored in this directory prior to transmission.

 * docs/
    * This directory contains miscellaneous tutorials and documents relating to the project.

Shell Scripts:
 * initializeSubmodules.sh
    * Initializes all of the submodule repositories contained inside of the CPE-657 project.
    * NOTE: This script must be executed every time that the repository is cloned for the first time.
 * Makefile
    * Compiles the Pi Hat C++ profiler (Make Targets: all, clean).
 * multithreaded_test.sh
    * Runs the sentinel2-cloud detector tests that were exported using the Jupyter notebook.
    * This script spawns four tests and launches them on their own unique core.
 * runImageGenerationExperiment_OnePiConfiguration.sh
    * Launches a full image generation experiment.
    * The script performs the following:
       1) Runs Network Encryption Python Script (Encrypts all image files)
       2) Runs Network Compression Python Script (Compresses all encrypted files)
       3) Runs Network Cloud Discrimination Python Script (Generates sentinel2-cloud detector image files) 
       4) Runs Pi Hat Profiler Executable (Records power measurements from the Raspberry Pi)
    * The script expects FOUR COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS:
       1) argv1 - FTP Server IP Address (Required)
       2) argv2 - FTP Server Port (Required)
       3) argv3 - Compression Data Client IP Address (Optional - Defaults to localhost if not supplied.)
       4) argv4 - Image Data Client IP Address (Optional - Defaults to localhost if not supplied.)
       5) Encryption Data Client IP Address (Optional - Defaults to 0.0.0.0 if not supplied.)
 * runFileCompressor_FourPiConfiguration.sh
    * The script performs the following:
       1) Runs Network Compression Python Script (Compresses all encrypted files)
       2) Runs Pi Hat Profiler Executable (Records power measurements from the Raspberry Pi)
    * The script expects ONE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS:
       1) argv1 - Compression Data Client IP Address (Optional - Defaults to localhost if not supplied.)
 * runCloudDiscriminator_FourPiConfiguration.sh
    * The script performs the following:
       1) Runs Network Cloud Discrimination Python Script (Generates sentinel2-cloud detector image files) 
       2) Runs Pi Hat Profiler Executable (Records power measurements from the Raspberry Pi)
    * The script expects ONE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS:
       1) argv1 - Image Data Client IP Address (Optional - Defaults to localhost if not supplied.)
 * runImageEncryptor_FourPiConfiguration.sh
    * The script performs the following:
       1) Runs Network Encryption Python Script (Encrypts all image files)
       2) Runs Pi Hat Profiler Executable (Records power measurements from the Raspberry Pi)
    * The script expects THREE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS:
       1) argv1 - FTP Server IP Address (Optional - Defaults to localhost if not supplied.)
       2) argv2 - FTP Server Port (Optional - Defaults to 21 if not supplied.)
       3) argv3 - Encryption Data Client IP Address (Optional - Defaults to 0.0.0.0 if not supplied.)
 * killImageGenerationProcesses.sh
    * Kills all processes associated with the image generation experiment (Network Encryptor, Network Compressor, Network Cloud Discrimination, and Pi Hat Profiler).
 * turnOffRaspberryPi4_UsbPorts.sh
    * Turns off USB ports on the Raspberry Pi 4.
    * Note: In order for the changes to take effect, this script must be executed every time that the Raspberry Pi 4 is turned on since the settings reset upon system reboot.
 * changeRaspberryPi4_ScalingGovernor.sh
    * Changes the Raspberry Pi 4 scaling governor.
    * The script expects FOUR COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS:
       1) argv1 - Scaling Governor Option (powersave=0, performance=1, ondemand=2)
    * Note: In order for the changes to take effect, this script must be executed every time that the Raspberry Pi 4 is turned on since the settings reset upon system reboot.
 * runPiHatProfiler.sh
    * Runs the Pi Hat Profiler at the designated sampling rate and writes the output to a time-stamped CSV file.
    * The script expects TWO COMMAND-LINE ARGUENTS:
       1) argv1 - Sampling Rate in milliseconds (Optional, defaults to 10 ms if not provided).
       2) argv2 - Experiment Name which is appended to the output CSV filename (Optional, defaults to "idleRun" if not provided).

Supplemental Information:
 * The necessary python programs have been precompiled as executables and packaged with all necessary runtime files for your convenience.
 * This package had files that were too large for Github and so it can be accessed at the following drive link (will need to be logged in to an @uah.edu email to access): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1puyj_BtT5TnHnwZBFc1dmSyPdyPqO0Ku?usp=sharing 
 * An additional library was used to perform power measurements. The git repository for that is located here: https://github.com/regisin/ina219.git
